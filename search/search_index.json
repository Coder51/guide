The contents of this guide should be taken as recommendations based on what has worked for us in the past. If new ideas come up and sound reasonable to the planning committee, by all means explore it and implement it. If it works out well, modify this guide. This is not meant to strike down good ideas or to be the end-all for any disagreements. Contributing to the Guide # This guide is created using MkDocs , a documentation tool that uses Markdown .
